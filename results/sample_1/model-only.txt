Creating a Snake game for the web with a database to save player's scores involves several steps and requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend language like Node.js or PHP. Here's a high-level overview of how you can create this game:

1. **HTML/CSS**: Create the game's user interface using HTML and CSS. This includes the game board, score display, game over screen, and controls.

2. **JavaScript**: Implement the game logic in JavaScript. This includes the snake's movement, food generation, game controls, and game over conditions.

3. **Backend**: Create a backend to handle database operations. You can use Node.js with Express.js or PHP with Laravel as your backend framework.

4. **Database**: Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to store player scores. You'll need to create a table or collection to store the scores, including the player's username, score, and timestamp.

5. **API**: Create an API endpoint to save player scores to the database. When the game ends, send a POST request to this endpoint with the player's score and username.

6. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication to ensure that only registered users can save their scores. You can use libraries like Passport.js for Node.js or Laravel's built-in authentication system for PHP.

7. **Displaying Scores**: Create an endpoint to fetch the top scores from the database and display them on the game's leaderboard.

8. **Testing**: Test the game thoroughly to ensure it works correctly and is enjoyable for players.

Here's a simple example of how the API endpoint to save scores might look in Node.js with Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();
const db = require('./db'); // Database connection

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/save-score', (req, res) => {
  const { username, score } = req.body;

  db.query(
    'INSERT INTO scores (username, score) VALUES (?, ?)',
    [username, score],
    (err, results) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        res.status(500).send('Error saving score.');
      } else {
        res.send('Score saved successfully.');
      }
    }
  );
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000.');
});
```

This is just a starting point, and you'll need to expand upon this example to create a complete Snake game with score saving and a leaderboard. Good luck with your project!
