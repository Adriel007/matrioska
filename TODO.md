# TODO — Matrioska V3

## Providers & Models

- [ ] **HuggingFace provider** — `_hf_chat()` still raises `NotImplementedError`.
  Port the v2 HuggingFace integration or support any Transformers pipeline.

- [ ] **Ollama provider test** — The native Ollama path works but is untested since
  v3 migration. Validate streaming and tool-use fallback.

## Memory & Knowledge

### Obsidian-compatible Vault (Local + Global + Cross-project)

*Fundamentação: Karpathy LLM Wiki Pattern (abr/2026, 16M views, 5k★),
LightRAG dual-level graph (EMNLP 2025, arXiv 2409.14813),
GAM Hierarchical Graph-based Agentic Memory (arXiv 2604.12285),
engraph/MCPVault/obsidian-mcp — 24+ MCP servers para vaults Obsidian.*

**A ideia central (Karpathy):** em vez de RAG puro (re-derivar relações a cada
query), "compilar" o conhecimento em Markdown permanente. O vault é o binário: notas
de conceitos, padrões e bugs atualizados incrementalmente após cada run. O Matrioska
já armazena runs em Markdown + YAML frontmatter em `knowledge/runs/` — está a um
passo de ser um vault Obsidian nativo.

### Outros itens de Memory

- [ ] **GraphRAG auto-ingest** — Semantic memory tracks concepts and relationships
  but doesn't auto-extract them from run artifacts. Add LLM-based entity extraction
  on `write_run_note()` to populate the knowledge graph.

- [ ] **ChromaDB lazy download** — First-run downloads 79 MB of ONNX model for
  embeddings. Show a progress bar and consider making embeddings optional
  (keyword-only fallback).

## CLI & DX

- [ ] **Model validation on startup** — When `--dry-run` is not set, validate that
  the configured model(s) exist on the provider before spending tokens.

## MCP Server & API

- [ ] **Full MCP integration** — `matrioska serve` uses the `mcp` library scaffold
  but `mcp` is an optional dependency. Test end-to-end with Claude Desktop and
  verify all 3 tools (run, show, resume) work.

## Eval & Metrics

- [ ] **Benchmark parallelization** — `poc.py` currently runs tasks and orchestrators
  sequentially: `for task in tasks: for orch in ORCHESTRATORS:`. Since tasks are
  independent (no inter-task dependencies), they could run in parallel via
  ProcessPoolExecutor, reducing benchmark time from ~40min to ~10min. Similarly,
  orchestrators on the same task are independent and could run in parallel.
  Caveat: daily API quota is shared, so parallel runs may hit rate limits sooner.
  Recommend: parallelize tasks first (ProcessPoolExecutor with max_workers=2-3),
  then orchestrators if quota permits.

- [ ] **Automated golden suite CI** — The 30-task golden suite exists but requires
  a real API key. Set up a scheduled CI run (e.g., GitHub Actions weekly) that
  posts results to a dashboard.

- [ ] **Execution success metric** — The MVP baseline shows `execution_success_rate:
  0%` because sandbox was never wired. Once sandbox works, measure whether
  generated code actually runs and produces correct output.

## Observability

- [ ] **OpenTelemetry instrumentation** — `otel_endpoint` config exists but nothing
  is instrumented. Add spans for each pipeline phase, file generation, and LLM
  call, exportable to LangFuse / Grafana.

- [ ] **Cost tracking per provider** — Track actual cost (not estimated) for
  providers that return cost in usage metadata. Fall back to estimation for others.

## Technical Debt

- [ ] **Type annotations audit** — Several `Dict[str, Any]` could be more specific
  (e.g., `SharedState`, `ArtifactMap`). Add type aliases in `core/types.py`.

- [ ] **Test coverage for bug fixes** — Tests exist for imports, config, contracts,
  and DAG layering, but not for the bugs found (generator shadow, missing _emit,
  code fence stripping, rate limit retry). Add integration tests for ACI repair
  and test designer pipeline.

## Completed in this session

- [x] **Execution success metric** — `phase3.py` now calls `metrics.record_execution(ok)`
  after sandbox runs. `MetricsCollector.snapshot()` returns `None` for
  `execution_success_rate` when sandbox never ran (distinguishes "not measured"
  from "0%"). SUMMARY output shows `Sandbox: ✓/~/✗ execution_success=N%`.

- [x] **ChromaDB lazy download** — Already implemented in `memory/semantic.py`.
  `_chroma_model_cached()` checks for `.onnx` files before download.
  `_notify_download()` shows a Rich spinner on first run; falls back to plain
  print when Rich unavailable.

- [x] **Cost tracking per provider** — `ChatResponse.actual_cost_usd` field added.
  `_openai_compatible_chat()` extracts `usage.total_cost` (OpenRouter et al.).
  Emitted in `llm_done` event. `TokenTracker` accumulates actual cost separately
  from estimate; `snapshot()` exposes both `actual_cost_usd` and `estimated_cost_usd`.
  SUMMARY prints "(provider-reported)" vs "(estimated)". Dashboard prefers actual
  cost on final sync.
